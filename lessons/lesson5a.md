## Lesson Objectives
- Share a web map
- Share a project package

## Share a Web Map
Maps created in ArcGIS Pro can be shared to ArcGIS Online as an interactive web map. From there, they can be shared further with groups or the public, embedded in a website, or used to create an app. The following video shows the process of sharing a web map.

## Share a Project Package
Another way to share a project is to create a project package. A project package includes all components of a project and can be saved to file or shared to ArcGIS Online. This allows for collaboration or creating a copy of the project as a backup.

> Follow along with the steps from Esri's documentation page to [Share a project package](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.1/help/sharing/overview/project-package.htm), or see below for a brief overview of the process.

In the Share tab, select Project. Choose to save the project either to file or upload to your ArcGIS account and fill out the required parameters.
