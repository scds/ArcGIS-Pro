## Lesson Objectives
- Be introduced to the concept of geographic and projected coordinate systems and why they're important.
- Learn to convert datasets between two coordinate systems.

## Coordinate Reference Systems

Coordinate reference systems are a way of referencing the location of features on the earth's surface. There are two methods â€“ geographic coordinate systems and projected coordinate 
systems.

### Geographic Coordinate Systems

Geographic coordinate systems express locations as angles from a point. They are made up of a series of *meridians* - lines of longitudes which converge at the poles, and *parallels* - lines of latitudes that run parallel and never meet.

### Projected Coordinate Systems

Projected coordinate systems are a method of representing the earth in two dimensions. Locations in this case are represented as distances from a reference point. 

By projecting a round earth onto a flat surface, you introduce distortion. The example shown on this slide is the Mercator projection. As shown by the red grid lines, the areas of least distortion are closer to the equator, increasing as you get closer to the poles.

For a comprehensive list of different projections and types, along with their properties, suitable extents, location, orientation, and purpose, see the following chart from Esri, adapted from a USGS map projections poster.

### Why is this important?

Choosing a coordinate system that matches your study area and intended use will limit unintended distortion and misrepresentation or misinterpretation of the map. Take for example these two maps of Canada.

## In ArcGIS Pro

The activities in the following sections will use the Map Projections Project Package from Esri, available at the following link.

[Map Projections Project Package]() (direct download)

This project package is used in the [Choose the right projection](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/choose-the-right-projection/) tutorial from Esri, available through the [Learn ArcGIS website](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/gallery/).

### Map Properties: Coordinate Systems

<!-- Within ArcGIS Pro, you can change both the coordinate system of the map as well as the data. This first activity will show how to change the coordinate system of the map through the *Map Properties*.

### Project Data

## Summary
This lesson covered: 
- An introduction to the concept and importance of coordinate reference systems, and geographic and projected coordinate systems.
- How to choose the coordinate system for your map.
- How to convert, or project, data between coordinate systems.

## Additional Resources (optional)
Portions of this lesson were drawn from the Esri tutorial *Choose the right projection*. 

For more information on projection types and the properties of different projections that will help you decide which one is best for your application, see - [Choose the right projection](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/choose-the-right-projection/). This tutorial will also show how to modify existing projected coordinate systems and create a custom one.
