## Lesson Objectives
- Switch between basemaps in ArcGIS Pro.
- Learn about projections and coordinate systems and how they may affect maps.
- Get to know different symbology options based on different data types - numeric and thematic or categorical.

## Basemaps
The first option for map symbology are basemaps. This is one of the simplest ways of styling a map.

ArcGIS Pro includes a number of basemaps in the basemap gallery. These include a default topographic map, imagery, feature specific options, as well as simple grayscale maps. These can be seen in the embedded ArcGIS Online map, or by clicking the Basemap button in ArcGIS Pro, shown below.

> Explore the available basemap options in the above map by using the basemap selector (button with four squares) to switch between basemaps.                   <!-- Question Text -->
> 
> In ArcGIS Pro, open the project from the previous lesson and try switching between basemaps to see how they appear with data overlaid.
> 
> Zoom in and out on the map to see how the basemap changes at different scales.                <!-- Optional Additional Text -->
