## Projections and Coordinate Systems

Coordinate reference systems are a way of referencing the location of features on the earth's surface. There are two methods â€“ geographic coordinate systems and projected coordinate 
systems.

### Geographic Coordinate Systems

Geographic coordinate systems express locations as angles from a point. They are made up of a series of *meridians* - lines of longitudes which converge at the poles, and *parallels* - lines of latitudes that run parallel and never meet.

### Projected Coordinate Systems

Projected coordinate systems are a method of representing the earth in two dimensions. By projecting a round earth onto a flat surface, you introduce distortion. 
Locations in this case are represented as distances from a reference point. 
The example shown on this slide is the Mercator projection. As shown by the red grid lines, the areas of least distortion are closer to the equator, increasing as you get closer to the poles.

### Why is this important?

Depending on which geographic or projected coordinate system you use, you can visually misrepresent your data which may also cause errors in measurement or result in datasets being offset from their locations and one another.

> Examine the maps and make note of differences between the two.
