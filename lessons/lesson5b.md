## Lesson Objectives
- Create a map layout
- Export the map to PDF or image file format such as JPG

## Map Layouts
Map layouts are used to design the map for printing or publication and include map elements such as a title, scale bar, north arrow, legend, and data sources. 

The following video guides you through the process of creating, exporting, and printing a map layout. The text version of this lesson is available through the ArcGIS Pro [Quick Start Tutorials](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/add-maps-to-a-layout.htm) from Esri.
