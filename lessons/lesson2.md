## Lesson Objectives
- Switch between basemaps in ArcGIS Pro.
- Learn where to find additional basemaps, including ones built with accessibility in mind.
- Learn how to make your own basemap.

## Basemaps
One of the first ways to symbolize your map is to choose a basemap which provides a background and context for your data.

### Basemap Options
ArcGIS Pro includes a number of basemaps in the basemap gallery. These include a default topographic map, imagery, feature specific options, as well as simple grayscale maps. These can be seen by clicking the Basemap button in ArcGIS Pro, as shown below.

> Activity
> 
> In ArcGIS Pro, open the project from the previous lesson and try switching between basemaps in the Central Wellington map to see how they appear with the data.
> 
> Zoom in and out on the map to see how the basemap changes at different scales.
>
> Where multiple layers (e.g. base, reference, hillshade) make up the basemap, try toggling on and off each of the basemap layers to see the changes.
