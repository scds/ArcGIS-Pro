# Workshop preparation 

<!-- 
Seperate preparation into account creation, file downloads, and software downloads.
However, you can format this as you wish.
An example is provided below.
-->
## 1. Create an ArcGIS account
Navigate to the [ArcGIS Software Request form](https://mcmaster-ca.libwizard.com/f/arcgis) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.

{: .warning }
> You must be a current McMaster student, faculty, or staff member to request an account using the above form.
> Use of the software is restricted to teaching, learning, and scholarly research at McMaster.

## 2. Download the project file
Download the [ArcGIS Project Package file](https://mcmasteru365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/homuthc_mcmaster_ca/EuSoB-Dk4MdHgohGV_OKQbcBsBA4W3U7JVq7sb7fuaO0Tg?e=9oWgqw) that's been created for the purpose of this workshop.

## 3. Install the software
This hands-on workshop uses ArcGIS Pro. Please download and install the software in advance of the workshop to be able to participate in it to the fullest extent.

### Windows Installation
<!-- Usually, linking to an installation guide on the official website of the software is enough, no need to explain how to install. -->
<!-- If there are additional steps not covered in the installation guide, include them -->
Unfortunately, Mac OS is not a supported operating system for ArcGIS Pro. Follow the steps in the installation guide, below, to install the software on your PC.

Once the software is installed, sign in with your ArcGIS account to get started.
