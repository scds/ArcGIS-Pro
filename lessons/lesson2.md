## Lesson Objectives
- Switch between basemaps in ArcGIS Pro.
- Learn about projections and coordinate systems and how they may affect maps.
- Get to know different symbology options based on different data types - numeric and thematic or categorical.

## Basemaps
The first option for map symbology are basemaps. This is one of the simplest ways of styling a map.

ArcGIS Pro includes a number of basemaps in the basemap gallery. These include a default topographic map, imagery, feature specific options, as well as simple grayscale maps. These can be seen in the embedded ArcGIS Online map below.

> Explore the available basemap options by using the basemap selector (button with four squares) to switch between basemaps.                   <!-- Question Text -->
> 
> Zoom in and out on the map to see how the basemap changes at different scales.                <!-- Optional Additional Text -->
